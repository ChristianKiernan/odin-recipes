# odin-recipes
This is the first project in The Odin Project.
The goal was to produce a simple website consisting of a homepage and three recipe pages. The recipe pages follow the same general layout (including a description, ingredient list, and instructions). 
As someone with pre - acquired (albeit beginner level) HTML knowledge, but with minimal/no experience using Git or Github, the primary sticking/learning points were centered around dealing with version control.
